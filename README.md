# Stellar Mirai (Hatsune-Miku-Magical-Mirai-2024)

"Color the creative culture through programming". I love this phrase, so I took this idea to the stars. Stellar Mirai is an application where the user can draw upon the stars like constellations. Every phrase of the music brings more Miku stars until we are surrounded by a sea of blue-green. Unleash your artistic creativity while jamming to the sound of Miku!
